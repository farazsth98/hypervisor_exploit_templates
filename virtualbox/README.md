# Building and Debugging

See the [Building and Debugging](./build-and-debug-notes.md) document for information on how to build VirtualBox. This guide assumes VirtualBox 7.0.14, but any recent-ish version should work.

# Exploit primitives

I'm also noting down potential primitives and techniques that can help with exploits.

You can find these notes in the [Exploit Primitives](./exploit-primitives.md) document.
